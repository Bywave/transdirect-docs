### INTRODUCTION
A very warm welcome to the Transdirect Application Programming Interface (API) documentation that offers booking, tracking, and nationwide shipping and air freight service options suitable for all your delivery needs.
<ul>
<li>
Transdirect uses basic authentication through your member email and password. Example https://www.transdirect.com.au/api/bookings
</li>
<li>
Another way to authenticate is using the generated API key in the member’s area and to create a Custom header with the format "Api-key: [API-KEY-GENERATED]". Example https://www.transdirect.com.au/api/bookings/v4
</li>
<li>
You can generate your API key from Here.

## Welcome
There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.
Another way to authenticate is using the generated API key in the member’s area and to create a Custom header with the format "Api-key: [API-KEY-GENERATED]". Example https://www.transdirect.com.au/api/bookings/v4<br /><br /> */}
## A few notes:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Transdirect uses JSON and will retrieve a 415 error on invalid content types.<br />
</li>
<li>
Dates and Times are in ISO8601 format.
</li>
</ul>

{/* ## Authentication
All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.
```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
